# Why I'm Making This Guide #

Oh my god there are so [many][g] [freaking][f] [guides][e] [to][d] [Ruby's][c]
[C][b] [API][a]. Why make another one? Because from what I've seen of the
others:

* Most of them are outdated
* Most fail to cover different approaches when they are available
* Many cover only very specific use-cases
* Many have bad recommendations
* Many fail to explain _when_ and _why_ things are needed
* Many try to be exhaustive rather getting the reader up and running quickly

And it struck me that all of these problems come from these guides largely being
on media that do not promote community-driven updates. So I'm writing a new
guide that doesn't suck and is on Github so you too can help make it not suck.
